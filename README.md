 # INF1636 - 2016.1 (Ludo Board Game)

The object-oriented programming (INF1636) discipline project of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in the first half of 2016. Its objective is to implement a board game, called ludo, in Java. The project consists of a logical part and a graphical interface.

We implemented a Ludo board game in Java, using some design patterns:
Singleton;
Facade;
Observer.

Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
